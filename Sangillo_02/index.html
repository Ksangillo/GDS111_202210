<p> Hello my name is Kyle Sangillo I am in my third year of service for the <a href="https://www.nationalguard.com/" class="Army">Army National Guard</a>, I have one deployment under my belt. Using the Post 9/11 GI Bill I am able to pay for the school i've always wanted to go to since middle school. I've been a huge gamer since I was a wee lad and recently started getting into Dungeons and Dragons. I would say some of my favorite games to play are story based games however I enjoy survival games the most with friends. I'm currently trying to get into the game industry for a career but I'm not sure whether I will go more the Programming side or the Design side. I've had a bad expereince with coding from high school so I'm a bit nervous for this class however so far its seem very interesting. I've recently taken up streaming on twitch and wish to do more of it when time permits in the future, I'm hoping that I'll have a decent following and be able to do sponserships with games and I would really like to create a online Dungens and Dragons Show as well.</p>

<p>Currently I live in Moodus, CT But during the week I will be staying at my friends in Hope, RI I was deployed in 2020 to Afghanstan to do a mission simliar to TSA work, it was fairly boring for the most part because of covid it reduce our work load so we ended up playing video games, working out, and doing game competions. The Base was surrounded my a huge mountain range so it was cool to glance at sometimes, we would often say that if the country wasn't in such chaos that it would make a impressive ski attraction as there was a lot of snow that would form at the top. I have come to realization after coming back from Afghanstan that I have moderatley high social anxiety however I've been trying to be less secluded and be more socialable. I hoping this school year will be good I plan on joining events and clubs to try to make some new friends and have a good college expereince.</p>
