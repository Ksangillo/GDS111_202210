                <p id="paragraph"> Hello my name is Kyle Sangillo I am in my third year of service for the <a href="https://www.nationalguard.com/" class="Army">Army National Guard</a>, I have one deployment under my belt. Using the Post 9/11 GI Bill I am able to pay for the school i've always wanted to go to since middle school. I've been a huge gamer since I was a wee lad and recently started getting into Dungeons and Dragons. I would say some of my favorite games to play are story based games however I enjoy survival games the most with friends. I'm currently trying to get into the game industry for a career but I'm not sure whether I will go more the Programming side or the Design side. </p>
