Hello my name is Kyle Sangillo I am in my third year of service for the Army National Guard, I have one deployment under my belt. Using the Post 9/11 GI Bill I am able to pay for the school I've always wanted to go to since middle school. I was deployed in 2020 to Afghanstan to a mission simliar to TSA work I've been a huge gamer since I was a wee lad and recently started getting into Dungeons and Dragons. I'm currently trying to get into the game industry for a career, i'm not sure whether I will go more the programming side or the design side.
